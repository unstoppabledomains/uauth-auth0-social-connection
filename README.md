# Unstoppable Domains + Auth0 social connection

At Unstoppable Domains our passion is to help every Internet user become a web3 user. We believe NFT domains are central to managing identity in the Metaverse. As more users are active in web3, applications need to support crypto wallet sign in to keep pace with their changing user base.

Login with Unstoppable is our solution to crypto wallet sign in, allowing the owner of an NFT domain to selectively share pieces of their portable identity with your application. Our partnership with Auth0 offers a friction free approach to web3 sign in by leveraging their industry standard programming model.

We've provided a short demo video showing how easy it is to integrate Login with Unstoppable to your application using Auth0.

## What is Auth0?

Auth0 helps you to:

* Add authentication with [multiple authentication sources](https://auth0.com/docs/identityproviders), either social like **Google, Facebook, Microsoft Account, LinkedIn, GitHub, Twitter, Box, Salesforce, among others**, or enterprise identity systems like **Windows Azure AD, Google Apps, Active Directory, ADFS or any SAML Identity Provider**.
* Add authentication through more traditional [username/password databases](https://auth0.com/docs/connections/database/custom-db).
* Add support for [linking different user accounts](https://auth0.com/docs/link-accounts) with the same user.
* Support for generating signed [JSON Web Tokens](https://auth0.com/docs/jwt) to call your APIs and **flow the user identity** securely.
* Analytics of how, when, and where users are logging in.
* Pull data from other sources and add it to the user profile, through [JavaScript rules](https://auth0.com/docs/rules/current).
